# gitlaw
A testing attempt to put laws under control. This attempt is with Spanish 1978 Constitution

The purpose of this repository was initially:
* Show someone who is not a developer what a source control can do

So I picked up spanish constitution from wikicommons, did some simplification and came with a html version on how the constitution
was in 1978, then I did the 2 changes the constitution has suffered.

But then I started reading some articles (do google on gitlaw) and saw some initiatives that already took place on laws:

...

So I noticed this could be an experiment, basically try to use github to reflect certain laws (no big attempt yet to have full control)
and see which conventions should be made.

- Law format: sure it must be text, but certain (low) foratting is needed, how can that be done. I tried simple html with line
separation among html and doc, but when seeing it in github you see html and when checking differences you might be distracted
with that too.

- Coment format: Which languages (I started spanglish, maybe should be native - e.g. for spanish law, spanish, then english)
What other usefull information can the comment bring? area of influence (region and time?)
